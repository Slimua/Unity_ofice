## Introduction

Facade works as a API layer over all other Univer packages (expect for Uniscript) so that you can use Univer without knowing the details of the architecture.

Though Facade may suites for most of the use cases, you may find it more powerful and easier to extend Univer by using the packages directly.

## Usage

### Installation

```shell
npm i @univerjs/facade
```
